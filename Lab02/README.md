**Key Skills and Topics:**
- Renaming layers and setting appropriate **drawing order** based on geometry (point, line, polygon)
- Setting a **map coordinate system** (NAD 1983 UTM Zone 17N) and **display units** (meters)
- Using **bookmarks**, **zoom tools**, and **extent navigation** to move around the map
- Measuring the **length of the Tennessee River** and the **area/perimeter of the park**
- Classifying vegetation using:
  - **Single-field symbology** (based on `CLASS`)
  - **Dual-field symbology** (based on `CLASS` and `SUBCLASS`)
- Cleaning up symbology using a **Greens color ramp**, removing outlines, and applying transparency
- Labeling features (e.g., survey plots using the `POLY_NUM` field) and setting a **reference scale**
- Exporting the final Shiloh map as a JPEG

**West Africa Map Highlights:**
- Isolated cities in **West Africa** by selection and created a new feature layer
- Symbolized cities using **proportional symbols** based on **population size**
- Customized symbol size, color, and class breaks for better visual impact
- Applied consistent symbology for supporting layers (e.g., lakes, rivers, countries)
- Labeled cities with names and adjusted fonts and scale visibility
- Exported a clean and informative proportional symbol map as a JPEG

**Reflection:**  
> This lab helped solidify my understanding of how **symbology can be used to effectively communicate both categorical and numerical data**. It also emphasized the importance of visual hierarchy, color choices, and clean labeling when designing maps for presentation.
