# SCG150-Principles-of-GIS
Coursework for SCG150 Principles of GIS

This repository contains my work from a **Principles of ArcGIS** course, including 11 lab assignments and a final project. The course introduced key GIS concepts using ArcGIS Pro, building foundational skills in spatial analysis, data management, cartographic design, and more.

Each lab focused on a specific set of GIS tools and techniques. This repo serves both as a personal archive and a showcase of my learning progress throughout the semester.

## 🧪 Lab 1 – Introduction to ArcGIS Pro

**Objective:**  
Get familiar with the ArcGIS Pro interface, navigation tools, map views, and basic feature interaction. This lab emphasized organizing a GIS workspace and using fundamental tools like bookmarks, scale control, and measurement.

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Creating a structured folder system for organizing GIS files
- Opening a pre-made ArcGIS Pro project and navigating between 2D maps, 3D scenes, and layouts
- Using the **Explore** tool to navigate a map of Wellington, New Zealand
- Measuring **distance** and **area** using the Measure tool
- Identifying **map views** and switching between them (Central Wellington, 3D Scene, Layout)
- Accessing and interpreting **layer properties**, including coordinate systems and metadata
- Viewing and sorting data in the **Attribute Table** (e.g., finding the park with the largest area)
- Exploring the use of **symbols**, **symbology**, and **dockable panes** in the ArcGIS Pro interface

**Sample Results:**
- 🌍 **Width of Wellington City:** ~19.67 km  
- 📐 **Area:** ~289.89 km²  
- 🏞 **Largest park:** Te Kopahau Reserve  
- 🏢 **Data credit for building layer:** Wellington City Council

**Reflection:**  
> "I enjoyed seeing tabular data selection show up on the visual map. I struggled at times finding some of the buttons, but overall I really like the layout and user experience in ArcGIS."
